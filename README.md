## A CRUD RESTful API in Node.js that runs on an Express sever and uses a PostgreSQL database to fetch users from local database

To start back-end server:
cd backend-fetch-users
node index.js

In browser:
Live server index.html in frontend-fetch-users

Use postman to make requests without frontend

```
