## A CRUD RESTful API

**using Node.js that runs on an Express sever and uses a PostgreSQL local database to fetch users**

To start back-end server:
cd backend-fetch-users
node index.js

In browser:
Live server index.html in frontend-fetch-users

Use postman to make requests without frontend

Use postico to make SQL queries and view data quickly:

```SQL
SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY id ASC;
```
